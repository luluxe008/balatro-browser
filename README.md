# Balatro Browser
Forked from [web-balatro](https://github.com/W0W53R/web-balatro).

I use it to play balatro on mobile devices, and it works pretty good.

Huge thanks to W0W53R who did all the heavy lifting.

## Installation

This project does not need to be built, so installation is as simple as using `git clone` or downloading the source from github.

## Limitations

For some reasons, saving never works.

In this fork, there are no portable version, no mods, no save, no caching.
