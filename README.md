# Balatro Browser
Forked from [web-balatro](https://github.com/W0W53R/web-balatro).

I use it to play balatro on mobile devices, and it works pretty good.

Huge thanks to W0W53R who did all the heavy lifting.

## Installation

This project does not need to be built, so installation is as simple as using `git clone` or downloading the source from github.

## Limitations

For some reasons, saving never works.

In this fork, there are no portable version, no mods, no save, no caching.

## Disclamer

This code can be used to distribute a working copy of Balatro. HOWEVER, you should NOT do it on the internet, or in public. Distributing a copy of Balatro is NOT legal, and I do not encourage you to do it. The most legal way to use this site is to use your own copy of the Balatro each time and to not share it with other. This repositorie does NOT contain a copy of Balatro, as it would be illegal. 

If you want to be able to download of copy of Balatro from the site, you should put the copy in the game/ folder and name it "Balatro.exe" (its normal name on Windows with Steam)
