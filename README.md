# Balatro Browser
Forked from [web-balatro](https://github.com/W0W53R/web-balatro).

I use it to play balatro on mobile devices, and it works pretty good.

Huge thanks to W0W53R who did all the heavy lifting.

## Usage
Create a game/ directory.

Copy your own balatro copy in the game/ directory.

You can now download your own version from the site and use it in the "Load executable"

## Installation

This project does not need to be built, so installation is as simple as using `git clone` or downloading the source from github.

## Limitations

For some reasons, saving never works.
In this fork, there are no portable version, no mods, no save, no caching.

## Disclamer

Distributing a copy of Balatro is NOT legal, you need to use your own copy of the Balatro each time and do not share it with other. This repository does not contain any game files, assets, or copyrighted material.
